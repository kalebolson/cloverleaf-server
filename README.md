# cloverleaf-server
Back end for https://github.com/kalebolson/cloverleaf-web-portal.git

This is being built locally with the front-end repo contained in a directory called 'client' within the root.
I'm tracking these as separate repositories to avoid a rebuild of both in CI when changes are only made to one side.
